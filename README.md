# Design-database
In this project, my group members and I were asked to create a database of online motorcycle taxi transaction receipts in the form of pick-up and drop-off services. The steps for creating a database from this project are changing receipt data into raw data, UNF, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, ERD then creating a database in MySQL.
